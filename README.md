# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Chris (@sandgraal)

I build things that mix **old-school charm** with **modern data craft**.

- ðŸŽ® **Retro web tinkerer** â€” I sometimes tinker around with a site celebrating classic games, pixel dashboards, and charts that feel like they belong on a CRT.
- ðŸ”„ **Change Data Capture nerd** â€” I like to write guides to help people understand change data capture and streaming data without getting overwhelmed by jargon.
- ðŸ›  **Cloud solution architecting by day** â€” deep into data pipelines, automation, and making distributed systems less painful.
